# 5 Day Coding Challenge

## Overview
From the period of 6th to 10th May, I have undergone the free coding bootcamp '5 Day Coding Challenge' by Code Institute, in which it provides a fundamental concept of web programming languages and building a webpage within 5 days of the period.


## What I have learnt each day 

- Day 1: **Challenge Overview & HTML Basics** - In the first day, I have been provided the foundations of HTML. This has been done by learning how to create, organise, and structure a webpage.
- Day 2: **Add Style with CSS** - On the second day, I was able to grasp with the main fundamentals of styling with CSS, and this was achieved through defining the design, layout and display variations. 
- Day 3: **HTML5 & The Semantic Web** - HTML5 is a markup language for presenting and structuring the content on the web, whereas the semantic web allows tags to be read directly.
- Day 4: **Responsive Design** - Responsive web design allowed me to create webpages that look good, regardless of the device, and enables the webpage to adjust different screen sizes, which has been done by defining the max-width.
- Day 5: **JavaScript Basics** - The fifth and final daily challenge covers the fundamentals of JavaScript, which focuses on the behaviour and interactions of the webpage.
